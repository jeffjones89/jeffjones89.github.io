  <p>I'm a newcomer, relatively speaking, to web development. But I'd also consider myself a lifelong early adopter of technology, and a big believer in the notion that data is the future -- and the present. </p>
  <p>After graduating from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2011, I spent three years in Washington, DC at two different companies in sales and account management roles. I had largely positive experiences at both companies, but was not fulfilled by either role. There was very little challenge mentally, and I could feel apathy creeping in given the somewhat repetitive nature of most sales oriented roles. </p>
  <p>That belief in data led me to Code Academy, Team Treehouse and eventually <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/washington-dc">General Assembly's Web Development Immersive</a> course in Washington, DC. It was a leap of faith, including forgoing income for 4+ months now, but one I was fully prepared to make to pursue something I believed in. The ability to connect users with data, manage how they interact with it and their ability to implement it in their lives, businesses or elsewhere is imminently fascinating. </p>
  <p>Outside of development, I have a strong network of friends around the country that I enjoy visiting. I also play golf, am a gamer, and have an unhealthy obsession with the North Carolina Tar Heels basketball team. If you want to talk PER, TS%, eFG%, BPM or any other advanced metric - college basketball or the NBA - drop me a line. </p>

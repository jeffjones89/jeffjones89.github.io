So what can you find here? I'm guessing it'll be a pretty diverse cross-section of content...definitely a lot of web development, a sprinkling of NBA and UNC basketball (particularly once the season starts), and, well, who knows what else.

I plan on sharing some of my experiences as I'm exposed to new technologies and have an opportunity to network with some of the other folks in the DC Tech scene.

As always, feel free to reach out to me on social media or via email. I'd love to hear from you!

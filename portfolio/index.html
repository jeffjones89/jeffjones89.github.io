  <div class="portfolio-wrapper">
    <p>A chronological journey through my four projects at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive June - October, 2015. Prior to General Assembly I had 1-2 months of part time, self-taught experience, but had never built a full scale application prior to taking the course. Many more projects and code samples can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jeffjones89"> GitHub profile.</a></p>

      <br></br>
      <p>My first project! It's funny to look back on this one and think how far I (and the rest of the WDI students) have come, relatively speaking, in the 9 weeks since it was due. This was our third week of the program, and it's definitely JQuery soup! Still, I was excited to get a somewhat functional game up and running given my knowledge base to date. I've thought about refactoring the code, but also like to have this as a reference of where I started as a developer. Link to code can be found  <a href="https://github.com/jeffjones89/blackjack"> here</a>. Technologies include:
        <ul class = "techs">
          <li>JavaScript |</li>
          <li>Jquery </li>
        </ul>

      <br></br>
      <p>SeedMe was the second project I built during WDI, during week 6 of the program. It's a Ruby on Rails application, designed to allow start-ups to post video links of their pitches, and connect and collaborate with other entreprenuers. SeedMe has hand-rolled user authentication, including a custom helper method for current_user, a liking and favoriting system using, with likes using the Acts As Votable gem and a rudimentary messaging system to allow users to send private messages to each other on the platform.  I included random clips from movies that I enjoy as dummy data.  Link to code can be found  <a href="https://github.com/jeffjones89/SeedMe/"> here</a>. Technologies include:
        <ul class = "techs">
          <li>Ruby |</li>
          <li>Rails |</li>
          <li>ActiveRecord</li>
        </ul>

      <br></br>
      <p>Menu Builder is a group application (with a totally original and creative name!) built during Week 9 of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. This is a single page application that utilizes the Nutritionix API to allow users to calculate nutritional value of a meal searching by restaurant or item. My role on the team was co-lead of the project, primarily focusing on the AJAX calls, handrolled user interface and object oriented JavaScript principles. Also point person on syncing up saving meals to the database. Link to code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jeffjones89/MenuBuilder"> here</a>. Technologies include:
        <ul class = "techs">
          <li>JavaScript/JQuery |</li>
          <li>Express |</li>
          <li>NodeJS |</li>
          <li>Sequelize |</li>
          <li>AJAX</li>

      <h2 class = "portfolio-title">Shots on Franklin</h2>
      <a href="https://shotsonfranklin.herokuapp.com/"><img src="/assets/shotsonfranklin.png" alt="menu home page"></a>
      <br></br>
      <p><strong> ALERT: Still tinkering! </strong> Shots on Franklin is an homage to my time in Chapel Hill/pet project that I decided to undertake as my final project in the Web Development Immersive. One of my favorite sites for advanced college basketball stats went behind a paywall so I figured I'd try and recreate what I could. It is a MEAN stack application that ties D3 data visualization to a custom AngularJS directive. Going into the week, I <ul>
        <li> had never built a restful API using MongoDB</li>
        <li> had never built a fullstack MEAN application</li>
        <li> had extremely limited exposure to D3js </li>
      </ul>

        I was able to get up and running with what I considered an MVP within the week. I'd like to keep playing around with the D3, and use this as a bit of a sandbox moving forward to tinker with Mongo and the intersection of a library (D3) and a framework (Angular) both built on the principle of binding data to the DOM.

      <p>Menu Builder is a group application (with a totally original and creative name!) built during Week 9 of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. This is a single page application that utilizes the Nutritionix API to allow users to calculate nutritional value of a meal searching by restaurant or item. My role on the team was co-lead of the project, primarily focusing on the AJAX calls, handrolled user interface and object oriented JavaScript principles. Also point person on syncing up saving meals to the database. Link to code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jeffjones89/MenuBuilder"> here</a>. Technologies include:

          <li>Express |</li>

      <p><strong> ALERT: Still tinkering! </strong> Shots on Franklin is an homage to my time in Chapel Hill/pet project that I decided to undertake as my final project in the Web Development Immersive. One of my favorite sites for advanced college basketball stats went behind a paywall so I figured I'd try and recreate what I could. It is a MEAN stack application that ties D3 data visualization to a custom AngularJS directive. Going into the week, I had </br>1) never built a restful API using MongoDB and </br>2) had extremely limited exposure to D3js </br>

        It was an ambitious project, but I was able to get up and running with what I considered an MVP within the week. I'd like to keep playing around with the D3, and use this as a bit of a sandbox moving forward to tinker with Mongo and the intersection of a library (D3) and a framework (Angular) both built on the principle of binding data to the DOM.
